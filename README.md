Note: server info should be kept private. Create a file just named '.env' in the main folder that only contains the DB_STRING as posted in discord server to connect to database.


Note: for first time installing, run npm i in the main folder and then 'cd client' and run npm i again. Afterwards, cd back to main folder and run the command 'npm run dev'. Shoul d work after that, it might give errors about yarn.lock but just ignore them/delete yarn.lock
